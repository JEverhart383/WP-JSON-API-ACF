WP-JSON-API-ACF
===============

By default the Wordpress JSON API: [WP-API](http://wp-api.org/) doesn't include Advanced Custom Fields.
This plugin fixes that. 

Grown from https://gist.github.com/rileypaulsen/9b4505cdd0ac88d5ef51 
but a plugin is nicer: I didn't want to modify the other plugin
 
Not actively in development, as I'm no longer involved with the project this was developed for. If you want to take over, let me know!
